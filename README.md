## About The Project

<!-- [![codegambit Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://codegambit.io) -->

`RAM` is an android social media app intended to focus on CS & tech related humour. Complete with the basic features of creating an account and uploading a post whlie interacting with other's posts; along with being able to add friends, view their profile, and chat with them.



### Built With

The frontend is built entirely with Flutter, making use of its many widgets and libraries. To communicate with the MySQL database on the backend, I wrote a custom REST API in PHP.

### Coming Up

I plan to continue to make updates that increase overall performance and offer new ways of interacting with others.
