CURRENTLY DOING == start to get posts to load automatically... basically all the post functionality
-- refreash when scroll to top, load more when scroll to bottom


then: figure out how to abstract the postlist
-- like we need to be able to filter the search, honestly like 4 separate ones? (home, profilePosts, profileUps, profileDowns)


to finish user updating: trying to get the images to update when they change it, not leave the page and come back
then: have it clear profile pictues of that name but not extnesion when the user updates.
        so it doesn't take up unnecsssary space




roadmap:
- all response messages
-- want to change api to return an int as the status msg, 0 == success, >0 == error code

✓- then work on the profile page
✓-- display proper information ( how often do we refresh? everytime they open it..?)

✓- lastly work on uploading and displaying pictures
-- have a window thast gets loaded in ( SELECT range(lastLoadedPID + 1, lastLoadedPID + 11) ) so they don't have to wait everytime they scroll

- lastly quality of life stuff and refactoring
-- fix spacing ( especially when keyboard is update )
--- look at the app on the emulator so it's a different perspective )
--- try putting everything in a single scroll thingy like the home page is
-- add restriction ( regex on email, min length on username and )
-- add page transitions / animations
-- just keep adding stuff lmao
-- move all the themes into one theme file (i.e. text input themes, fonts, )

AN ASIDE FOR DOWN THE ROAD:
to verify a user by email, have a link that triggers a column to flip in the db user table
- this allows them to change their password in the app ( i.e. app checks this column to allow resetting a password)
- just a little post link ( can do that in an email cause html right? )
